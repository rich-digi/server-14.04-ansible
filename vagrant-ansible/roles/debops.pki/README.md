This role will bootstrap and manage fully-fledged Public Key Infrastructure
entirely within Ansible. You can create Certificate Authorities
(stand-alone as well as chained together) which in turn can automatically
sign incoming Certificate Requests and provide you with fully-functional
OpenSSL or GnuTLS certificates for your entire infrastructure, for free.

`debops.pki` can also be used to easily distribute private keys and
certificates signed by an external CA to your hosts in an easy and
convenient way. Role will automatically create a set of symlinks to make
use of the certificates within your applications easy and intuitive.
